this is a work in progress python project used to make datasets for voice cloning. <br><br>
hopefully when it is done, it will make the processs of makeing a datasets easier


<h2 align="center">
Basic Idea
</h2>  

records audio in .wav format <br>
converts to text using speech recognition <br>
outputs to csv<br>
all within a GUI <br>
<br>
<br>
p.s.  still learning pyhton ;)


<h2 align = "center" >
installation and setup
</h2>

<h3>
run 
</h3>

> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

if you gen an error with py audio you might have to install the .whl manually.  
To start the program run 

>python record.py
